# Toon-Racers

This racing car game was created for the final assessment of COMP30019 Graphics and Interaction.
It was a group project and was done with 3 other students(Paul Hutchins, Jade Siang and Jasper Robbins).

Key aspects of the game include the use of shaders(the major one incorporated in the game name itself, being a toon shader and then a water shader), procedural terrain generation using the Diamond square algorithm, particle systems for the cars exhaust which depends on the car mode, normal or boost, and two different 
camera modes for driving, first and third person, with adjustable height and depth settings for the third person driving mode.

As part of the project, we also conducted evaluation for our game, and we used a variety of Querying and Observational techniques to interview our 10 participants.
We implemented their feedback to further improve the gameplay elements and the game in general.
